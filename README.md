# Topological-Sorting
This project has code for topological sorting of a graph. There are two variations of computing the topological ordering and both the methods are written in this project.


1. There are 4 java files
2.  TopologicalOrdering. java is the file that has the code for checking the topological order for the given DAG. The input is a file inputGraph.txt
3. Vertex.java, Edge.java, Graph.java contains the code for creating and accessing graph.
